# Advent2021

Here are my Elixir solutions to the Advent of Code 2021 challenges.
I earned all 50 stars this year!

This repo is structured as an umbrella app for no good reason.

To see the code for a particular day's challenge, look in e.g.,
`apps/day01/lib/day01.ex`.

The code is left as-is at the moment I got it to work (ok, I ran
the formatter on it afterwards too), and functions are generally
presented in the order I wrote them.

Enjoy.
